# IITA Solutions Platform - Claude Development Notes

## Project Overview
A Next.js application that connects users with IITA's climate-smart agricultural solutions across Sub-Saharan Africa. The platform uses intelligent country matching to find relevant solutions based on user role, challenge type, and location.

## Key Features Implemented

### üåç Smart Country Matching System
- **Neighboring Country Logic**: Automatically includes solutions from neighboring countries when searching
- **Priority Ranking**: Exact country matches are prioritized over neighbor matches
- **Database**: 23 African countries with neighbor relationships stored in `countries_neighbors` table

### üîß Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- **Components**: Dynamic dropdowns with search functionality
- **API**: Custom SolutionService for database operations

### üìä Database Schema
```sql
-- Main tables:
- solutions: Store project data with role-specific content (50+ solutions)
- countries_neighbors: African countries with neighbor relationships
- user_selections: Analytics tracking (optional)
```

### üéØ User Experience
1. **Dynamic Form**: Users select role, challenge, and location
2. **Real-time Updates**: Form text updates as user makes selections
3. **Smart Search**: Finds solutions in selected country + neighbors
4. **Role-Specific Content**: Tailored messaging for different user types
5. **Interactive Map**: Visual project exploration across Africa
6. **Solution Filtering**: Search and filter through multiple solutions
7. **Enhanced Display**: Tag-based visualization of countries and challenges

### üìà Recent Updates (Latest Session)
- **50 Sample Solutions**: Generated comprehensive climate-smart solutions based on IITA's work
- **Expanded Challenge Types**: Added 25+ new solution categories including:
  - Crop-specific: cassava, rice, yam, plantain, sweet_potato, banana
  - Technology: processing, storage, greenhouse, digital_services
  - Systems: agroforestry, agroecology, aquaculture, beekeeping
  - Management: pest_management, soil_fertility, water_management
  - Innovation: biofortification, climate_information, renewable_energy
- **Enhanced UI**: Added search functionality, solution counters, and improved formatting
- **Better Data Display**: Tag-based country and challenge visualization

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Content
- **Solutions**: 50+ climate-smart agricultural interventions
- **Geographic Coverage**: All 23 Sub-Saharan African countries
- **Solution Types**: Covering IITA's core focus areas from crop production to digital services
- **Role-Specific Content**: Tailored messaging for funders, policymakers, farmers, students, extension officers, researchers, and development practitioners

## Database Connection
- **URL**: https://iixkdjhacdvtcmsolpem.supabase.co
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Connected and functional with expanded dataset
- **Tables**: All created with comprehensive sample data

## Files Ready for Database
- `50_sample_solutions.sql` - SQL file with 50 IITA-based climate solutions
- Ready to be executed in Supabase SQL Editor

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server (localhost:3001)
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run lint       # Check code quality
```

## Key Files
- `/src/lib/solutionService.ts` - Core matching logic
- `/src/components/DynamicDropdown.tsx` - Searchable dropdowns with enhanced formatting
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Main application interface with search/filter functionality
- `/src/types/database.ts` - TypeScript definitions with expanded challenge types
- `/supabase_schema.sql` - Original database setup script
- `/50_sample_solutions.sql` - 50 comprehensive IITA solutions

## Next Steps
1. **Execute SQL**: Run `50_sample_solutions.sql` in Supabase to populate database
2. **Test with Full Dataset**: Verify country matching with 50+ solutions
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor query performance with larger dataset
4. **Content Review**: Validate solution content accuracy with IITA expertise
